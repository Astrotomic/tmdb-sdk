    "overview": "Wakanda and its metropolis, dominated by modern high-rise buildings, is a technically advanced nation in Africa that is cut off from the outside world and pretends to be a poor third world country. Thanks to a meteorite impact and a resulting source of raw material, the only local metal vibranium, the African country can make itself invisible to the rest of the world under a huge camouflage device. Also, because the source of progress could wreak havoc in the wrong hands, the early leaders of Wakanda opted for isolation, which continues to this day.",

However, T'Challa soon finds that he is challenged for the throne by factions within his own country as well as without. Using powers reserved to Wakandan kings, T'Challa assumes the Black Panther mantle to join with ex-girlfriend Nakia, the queen-mother, his princess-kid sister, members of the Dora Milaje (the Wakandan 'special forces') and an American secret agent, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war.",
