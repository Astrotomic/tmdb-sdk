This CV, read aloud by Emin, constitutes the sound-track to the video and provides contrasting background to the visual information on display. As Emin narrates her story of trauma and abuse, mixed with pleasure and success, the video takes the viewer on a journey through the artist's home. The artist is not visibly present in person until the last frames when she appears curled up naked on the floor of her sitting-room at the feet of her mother (who wears black sunglasses and looks away from both her daughter and the camera). Like Emin's handwritten CV, the video constitutes her self-portrait, in this instance adding the component of a journey around the space of her apartment to her narrating voice. -Tate\",\"poster_path\":\"\/rWwdwBae6vNl7JVvJev1no5DOaZ.jpg\",\"media_type\":\"movie\",\"adult\":false,\"original_language\":\"en\",\"genre_ids\":[],\"popularity\":2.04,\"release_date\":\"1997-01-01\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":7.8,\"vote_count\":4},{\"backdrop_path\":\"\/iiwWSq6pQmaEnIX5FYGg2uWe5qH.jpg\",\"id\":718314,\"title\":\"FILM\",\"original_title\":\"FILM\",\"overview\":\"A boy walks through an abandoned building and films the interior.

Neither of them had any idea that everything would change as the filming progressed, as an unforeseen danger threatened to rob Shamir of his talent.
