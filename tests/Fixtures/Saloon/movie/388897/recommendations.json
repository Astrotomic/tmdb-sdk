Cunt Vernacular\",\"overview\":\"Emin's video CV is an accompaniment to her work on paper, Tracey Emin CV 1995 (Tate T07632), which is a potted history of the artist's professional and emotional life from conception until 1995. This CV, read aloud by Emin, constitutes the sound-track to the video and provides contrasting background to the visual information on display. As Emin narrates her story of trauma and abuse, mixed with pleasure and success, the video takes the viewer on a journey through the artist's home. The artist is not visibly present in person until the last frames when she appears curled up naked on the floor of her sitting-room at the feet of her mother (who wears black sunglasses and looks away from both her daughter and the camera). Like Emin's handwritten CV, the video constitutes her self-portrait, in this instance adding the component of a journey around the space of her apartment to her narrating voice. -Tate\",\"poster_path\":\"\/rWwdwBae6vNl7JVvJev1no5DOaZ.jpg\",\"media_type\":\"movie\",\"adult\":false,\"original_language\":\"en\",\"genre_ids\":[],\"popularity\":2.04,\"release_date\":\"1997-01-01\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":7.8,\"vote_count\":4},{\"backdrop_path\":null,\"id\":820806,\"title\":\"Sun Song\",\"original_title\":\"Sun Song\",\"overview\":\"A short silent film by Joseph Bernard.\",\"poster_path\":\"\/zdET6A6H9o5VRAYo1f6Bt7aUe5R.jpg\",\"media_type\":\"movie\",\"adult\":false,\"original_language\":\"en\",\"genre_ids\":[],\"popularity\":1.063,\"release_date\":\"1979-01-01\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":6.0,\"vote_count\":1},{\"backdrop_path\":\"\/zA2wuYzHjLm3IGEjw45OkqLPvr5.jpg\",\"id\":461712,\"title\":\"Red Rooster Plymouth Rock\",\"original_title\":\"\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043a\",\"overview\":\"Valka is a young boy whose dream is to get a red Plymouth Rock breed rooster and teach him to dance.\",\"poster_path\":\"\/uO0JB2BZiqXjTYyIrrLlHB3eAXf.jpg\",\"media_type\":\"movie\",\"adult\":false,\"original_language\":\"ru\",\"genre_ids\":[10751],\"popularity\":3.643,\"release_date\":\"1975-06-13\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":5.0,\"vote_count\":1},{\"backdrop_path\":\"\/6I4JbqJgGE56fcMSEorXS6H77YA.jpg\",\"id\":46153,\"title\":\"Jethro Tull: Living With The Past\",\"original_title\":\"Jethro Tull: Living With The Past\",\"overview\":\"A veritable feast awaits fans of Ian Anderson's Jethro Tull on this elaborate DVD package, which boasts extensive concert footage and a load of extras.
