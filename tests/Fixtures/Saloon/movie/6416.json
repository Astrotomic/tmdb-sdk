So when the energetic, handsome Klaus Buch turns up with his beautiful girlfriend Helene, Helmut is quite ready to dismiss this dimly familiar acquaintance. But Klaus is overjoyed to recognize his old schoolmate Helmut, eager to recall every incident of their shared time, and to display every detail of this successful lifestyle as a fit sportsman and author. The precious days of privacy give way to an unwanted and awkward intimacy, as the Buchs and the Halms hike, dine and sail together. Their joint activities aggravate myriad psychological tensions among the four characters, which are all the more intensely ironic for their peaceful veneer and which must eventually erupt.\",\"popularity\":1.341,\"poster_path\":\"\/xN6uLEfBpq4PB9rfvfFct0wKknk.jpg\",\"production_companies\":[{\"id\":4606,\"logo_path\":\"\/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png\",\"name\":\"ZDF\",\"origin_country\":\"DE\"}],\"production_countries\":[{\"iso_3166_1\":\"DE\",\"name\":\"Germany\"}],\"release_date\":\"2007-06-30\",\"revenue\":0,\"runtime\":92,\"spoken_languages\":[{\"english_name\":\"German\",\"iso_639_1\":\"de\",\"name\":\"Deutsch\"}],\"status\":\"Released\",\"tagline\":\"\",\"title\":\"Runaway Horse\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":5.7,\"vote_count\":9}"
