She is married to a lazy husband and has four children, all named after her favorite Swedish Eurovision popstars. Her brother is a crossdressing guy self-titled \\\"Candy Darling\\\". Mona works in a retirement home for disabled people, where she is responsible for taking care of a young man named David who suffers a movement-restricting disease forcing him into a wheelchair. David's parents have abandoned him, as they wanted a normal child. Mona holds a big place in David's heart, and vica versa. David's goal is to get his parents to come and visit him, and he wants to show them that he is a great person, despite his handicap. Therefore he works with music on his computer, and his goal is to create a song, send it to \\\"The Cardigans\\\", a famous Swedish band and have them play the song and credit him, hoping his parents would spot it and want to visit him.\",\"popularity\":5.897,\"poster_path\":\"\/9VwP8fMxTVErL4w5SUdPfe6cMCz.jpg\",\"production_companies\":[{\"id\":2999,\"logo_path\":\"\/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png\",\"name\":\"SVT\",\"origin_country\":\"SE\"},{\"id\":327,\"logo_path\":\"\/vodjjKlAbwGeERPjrAhxZMBGPUc.png\",\"name\":\"Nordisk Film Sweden\",\"origin_country\":\"SE\"},{\"id\":1929,\"logo_path\":null,\"name\":\"Sonet Film\",\"origin_country\":\"SE\"},{\"id\":758,\"logo_path\":\"\/fft3jrctrZNcgAxgN1w5Givtzip.png\",\"name\":\"TV 2\",\"origin_country\":\"DK\"}],\"production_countries\":[{\"iso_3166_1\":\"SE\",\"name\":\"Sweden\"},{\"iso_3166_1\":\"DK\",\"name\":\"Denmark\"}],\"release_date\":\"2000-11-10\",\"revenue\":0,\"runtime\":108,\"spoken_languages\":[{\"english_name\":\"Swedish\",\"iso_639_1\":\"sv\",\"name\":\"svenska\"}],\"status\":\"Released\",\"tagline\":\"\",\"title\":\"Once in a Lifetime\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":4.5,\"vote_count\":22}"
