The story is that of a young Parisian whose parents have found a good match for him, a count\u2019s daughter. But when he goes to visit her in her country home, the handsome boy \u2013 whose Parisian manners are far removed from the rules of decorum that reign in the provinces \u2013 cannot open his heart to his lovely intended.
