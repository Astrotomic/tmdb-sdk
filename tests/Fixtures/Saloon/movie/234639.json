He decides to commit suicide so that his parents can use the insurance money to repay the debts, but he is saved by a fisherman named Gangadharan (Cochin Haneefa) and his employee Ramanan (Harisree Ashokan). When they notice Unni drowning, Unni pretends to be deaf and mute so that he can fake his death and the insurance money reaches his family. Gangadharan however has a debt of his own, to a Punjabi family of money lenders who have settled in Kerala. He is forced to make Unni and Ramanan to work at their home until he can repay it. A series of interesting events follow after Unni meets Pooja (Mohini) at the house, who is deaf and mute.\",\"popularity\":5.48,\"poster_path\":\"\/v1bbWKzG9RDZbemuEmTDCQWhGTc.jpg\",\"production_companies\":[],\"production_countries\":[],\"release_date\":\"1998-09-04\",\"revenue\":0,\"runtime\":146,\"spoken_languages\":[{\"english_name\":\"Hindi\",\"iso_639_1\":\"hi\",\"name\":\"\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940\"},{\"english_name\":\"Malayalam\",\"iso_639_1\":\"ml\",\"name\":\"\"},{\"english_name\":\"Punjabi\",\"iso_639_1\":\"pa\",\"name\":\"\u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0a40\"}],\"status\":\"Released\",\"tagline\":\"\",\"title\":\"Punjabi House\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":7.2,\"vote_count\":23}"
