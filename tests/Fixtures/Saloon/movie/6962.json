Although no one appears to believe him, his find certainly seems to have generated interest: Steffen is attacked shortly afterwards in his hotel room by strange men; then he discovers that the German embassy and the secret service are after him; and when his friend Dan is murdered, he goes into hiding.\",\"popularity\":11.805,\"poster_path\":\"\/thWAdfTM9JLCb9w2ShBH2gUByIA.jpg\",\"production_companies\":[{\"id\":198,\"logo_path\":null,\"name\":\"GFP Medienfonds\",\"origin_country\":\"\"}],\"production_countries\":[{\"iso_3166_1\":\"DE\",\"name\":\"Germany\"}],\"release_date\":\"2002-12-05\",\"revenue\":0,\"runtime\":182,\"spoken_languages\":[{\"english_name\":\"German\",\"iso_639_1\":\"de\",\"name\":\"Deutsch\"}],\"status\":\"Released\",\"tagline\":\"An adventure that started 2000 years ago...\",\"title\":\"The Hunt for the Hidden Relic\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":6.9,\"vote_count\":86}"
