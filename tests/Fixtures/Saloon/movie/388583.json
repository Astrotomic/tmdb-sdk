Literally sold to a master teacher, Sergei Rippas (Tarmo Manni) by his mother when he was still a child, the violin prodigy was forcefully and strictly raised to practice, practice, and perfect his technique. Once an adult, Arsi finds a way to escape the rigors of a U.S. tour and drowns his overworked self in drink, or seeks out one-night stands, or otherwise lets off steam. The tightly-wound spring that has been coiled since he was forced into his grueling training and work sessions -- shown through symbolic images -- eventually snaps in a healthy way, freeing Arsi at last to continue on, simply for the love of music.\",\"popularity\":2.47,\"poster_path\":\"\/qOpmTjHV74StdTmtybSzfobeL6w.jpg\",\"production_companies\":[{\"id\":115,\"logo_path\":null,\"name\":\"FilmTeknik\",\"origin_country\":\"SE\"},{\"id\":2396,\"logo_path\":\"\/v0U7OZwjgv2vmiHbS2HNqjX9MEc.png\",\"name\":\"Finnish Film Foundation\",\"origin_country\":\"FI\"},{\"id\":2302,\"logo_path\":\"\/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png\",\"name\":\"Svenska Filminstitutet\",\"origin_country\":\"SE\"},{\"id\":1728,\"logo_path\":\"\/sujSPQqxYIoKfjAyS8OaJ6hLNed.png\",\"name\":\"Sandrews\",\"origin_country\":\"SE\"},{\"id\":5975,\"logo_path\":\"\/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png\",\"name\":\"YLE\",\"origin_country\":\"FI\"},{\"id\":120360,\"logo_path\":null,\"name\":\"P-Kino\",\"origin_country\":\"FI\"}],\"production_countries\":[{\"iso_3166_1\":\"FI\",\"name\":\"Finland\"},{\"iso_3166_1\":\"SE\",\"name\":\"Sweden\"}],\"release_date\":\"1985-08-16\",\"revenue\":0,\"runtime\":121,\"spoken_languages\":[{\"english_name\":\"Finnish\",\"iso_639_1\":\"fi\",\"name\":\"suomi\"}],\"status\":\"Released\",\"tagline\":\"\",\"title\":\"Da Capo\",\"video\":false,\"vote_average\":2.0,\"vote_count\":1}"
