Referring to his 1991 film releases, The New York Times' critic, Janet Maslin, praised Reeves' versatility, saying that he \\\"displays considerable discipline and range. He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles.\\\" A repeated theme in roles he has portrayed is that of saving the world, including the characters of Ted Logan, Buddha, Neo, Johnny Mnemonic, John Constantine and Klaatu.\",\"birthday\":\"1964-09-02\",\"deathday\":null,\"gender\":2,\"homepage\":null,\"id\":6384,\"imdb_id\":\"nm0000206\",\"known_for_department\":\"Acting\",\"name\":\"Keanu Reeves\",\"place_of_birth\":\"Beirut, Lebanon\",\"popularity\":100.87,\"profile_path\":\"\/4D0PpNI0kmP58hgrwGC3wCjxhnm.jpg\"}"
